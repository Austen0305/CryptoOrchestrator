# Cursor Rules - Complete Setup ✅

**Date**: December 30, 2025  
**Status**: All 9 rules created and working

## ✅ Complete Rule Set

### Always Applied Rules (4)
These rules are automatically included in every chat session:

1. **`project-conventions.mdc`** - Project-wide conventions
2. **`python-fastapi.mdc`** - Python/FastAPI backend rules
3. **`react-typescript.mdc`** - React/TypeScript frontend rules
4. **`security-blockchain.mdc`** - Security and blockchain rules

### Context-Aware Rules (5)
These rules are applied when working with relevant files:

5. **`testing.mdc`** - Testing patterns (pytest, Vitest, Playwright)
6. **`database-migrations.mdc`** - Alembic migration patterns
7. **`deployment.mdc`** - Deployment patterns (Docker, K8s)
8. **`trading-blockchain-domain.mdc`** - Trading bot, DEX, blockchain patterns
9. **`service-architecture.mdc`** - Service layer, repository, DI patterns

## 🚀 How Rules Help the AI

With these 9 rules, the Cursor agent now understands:

1. **Project Structure** - Where files go, naming conventions
2. **Code Style** - Python Black, TypeScript Prettier, formatting
3. **Architecture** - Service layer, repositories, dependency injection
4. **Domain Logic** - Trading bots, DEX trading, blockchain patterns
5. **Security** - Private keys, validation, authentication
6. **Testing** - How to write tests for each layer
7. **Database** - Migration patterns, query optimization
8. **Deployment** - Docker, K8s, health checks
9. **Best Practices** - All project-specific conventions

## ✨ Next Steps

The rules are complete! The Cursor agent now has full context about:

- ✅ Code structure and organization
- ✅ Coding standards and conventions
- ✅ Architecture patterns
- ✅ Domain-specific business logic
- ✅ Security requirements
- ✅ Testing approaches
- ✅ Deployment procedures

You can now ask the AI to:
- Create new trading bots following project patterns
- Add new DEX aggregators
- Implement new services using the service layer pattern
- Write tests following project conventions
- Create database migrations
- And much more!

All rules are automatically applied based on the files you're working with. The AI will use the appropriate rules for context.
