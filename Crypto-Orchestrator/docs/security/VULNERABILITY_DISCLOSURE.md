# Vulnerability Disclosure Program

## Overview

CryptoOrchestrator maintains a responsible vulnerability disclosure program to ensure the security of our platform. We encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting Process

### Step 1: Identify a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Verify the vulnerability** - Ensure it's a real security issue
2. **Do not exploit** - Do not access or modify data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
3. **Do not disclose publicly** - Keep the vulnerability confidential until we've addressed it

### Step 2: Report via GitHub Security Advisories

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-orchestrator/security/advisories`
2. Click "New draft security advisory"
3. Fill out the form with:
   - **Title**: Brief description of the vulnerability
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation
   - **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
   - **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
   - **Impact**: What could an attacker do?

### Step 3: Response Timeline

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial Assessment | Within 7 days |
| Status Updates | Every 7 days |
| Resolution | Based on severity (see below) |

### Step 4: Coordination

- We will work with you to verify and understand the vulnerability
- We may ask for additional information or clarification
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will coordinate public disclosure timing

## Severity Guidelines

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Complete data breach
- **Response**: 24 hours | **Resolution**: 7 days

### High
- Privilege escalation
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service (affecting availability)
- **Response**: 48 hours | **Resolution**: 14 days

### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- **Response**: 7 days | **Resolution**: 30 days

### Low
- Information leakage
- Minor configuration issues
- Best practice violations
- **Response**: 14 days | **Resolution**: 90 days

## Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service attacks that don't affect availability
- Issues requiring physical access to a device
- Issues in third-party services we integrate with
- Issues in outdated browsers or operating systems
- Self-XSS (user must paste malicious code themselves)
- Missing security headers without demonstrated impact
- Clickjacking on pages without sensitive actions

## Safe Harbor

We provide safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Do not access or modify data beyond what's necessary
- Do not disrupt our services
- Do not violate any laws

## Recognition

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **Hall of Fame**: Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- **CVE Assignment**: For significant vulnerabilities
- **Special Thanks**: In security advisories

## Public Disclosure

We coordinate public disclosure with researchers:

1. **Embargo Period**: We maintain an embargo until the vulnerability is fixed
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work together on disclosure timing
3. **Credit**: We give credit to researchers (with permission)
4. **CVE Assignment**: We help assign CVEs for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Advisory Workflow

### Creating an Advisory

1. Go to repository Security tab
2. Click "Advisories"
3. Click "New draft security advisory"
4. Fill out the form
5. Submit for review

### Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Security team reviews the advisory
2. **Verification**: We verify the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release the fix
5. **Publication**: We publish the advisory

### Advisory Format

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of the vulnerability

## Affected Versions
- Version X.X.X and earlier

## Impact
What could an attacker do?

## Remediation
How to fix or mitigate

## Credits
Thanks to [Researcher Name] for responsible disclosure
```

## Best Practices for Researchers

1. **Be Respectful**: Don't be aggressive or demanding
2. **Be Patient**: Give us time to investigate and fix
3. **Be Clear**: Provide clear, detailed reports
4. **Be Responsible**: Don't exploit vulnerabilities
5. **Be Collaborative**: Work with us to improve security
