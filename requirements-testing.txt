# Minimal requirements for testing scripts only
# Use this when full requirements.txt fails (e.g., Python 3.13 compatibility issues)

# Core dependencies for testing scripts
web3>=7.14.0  # For blockchain/testnet interactions
httpx>=0.25.2  # For HTTP requests in load testing and performance monitoring

# Optional but recommended for security audit
safety>=2.3.5  # For Python dependency scanning
bandit>=1.7.6  # For Python code security scanning (already in requirements.txt)

# Note: For full project dependencies, use requirements.txt
# If TensorFlow installation fails on Python 3.13, you may need to:
# 1. Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 for the full project
# 2. Or install only testing dependencies with: pip install -r requirements-testing.txt
