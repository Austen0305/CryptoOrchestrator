- **Month 3**: 500 indicators × $50 avg price × 1% conversion = $15k/month
- **Month 6**: 1k indicators × $75 avg price × 1.5% conversion = $30k/month
- **Month 12**: 5k indicators × $100 avg price × 2% conversion = $80k+/month

### Self-Service Enterprise Features

- **Model**: Self-service tiered pricing ($50-500/month per institution, automated)
- **Month 3**: 10 self-service customers × $100 avg = $1k/month
- **Month 6**: 50 self-service customers × $200 avg = $10k/month
- **Month 12**: 200+ self-service customers × $250 avg = $50k+/month

### Trading Fees
