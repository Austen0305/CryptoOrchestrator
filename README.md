# CryptoOrchestrator (Experimental Prototype)

> [!WARNING]
> **This is an EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE and a partial implementation.** It is NOT production-ready, hasn't been audited, and should NOT be used for real-money trading without extreme caution and further development.

CryptoOrchestrator is a prototype SaaS platform for automated cryptocurrency trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It features an AI-driven approach to strategy execution and risk management across multiple blockchain networks.

## 🏗️ Current Status & Limitations

This project is currently in an **experimental phase** with only **partial implementations** of many features.

### 🚫 What is NOT Implemented/Verified
- **Production Security**: No formal security audits have been performed. PCI-DSS claims are invalid for this prototype.
- **Financial Guarantees**: "Zero vulnerabilities" claims are strictly avoided; assume risks exist.
- **Full Custody Support**: Wallet management logic is experimental and lack legal/regulatory backing for custodial operations.
- **Native Mobile Stability**: While screens are implemented, native device integration is incomplete.
- **Battle-Tested AI**: ML models are experimental and require significant calibration.
