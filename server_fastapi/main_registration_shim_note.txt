Temporary registration shim middleware added in main.py to short-circuit
/api/auth/register requests and avoid deeper middleware stack hangs.

This file exists only as documentation/reminder and can be removed once
the underlying middleware issue is fully resolved and the normal
server_fastapi.routes.auth.register endpoint is stable.
