## 💡 Recommendation

The project is **code-complete and optimized**, but needs **systematic testing and verification** to complete the TODO list.

**Would you like me to:**
1. **Start systematic feature testing** (test each feature end-to-end)
2. **Focus on critical path testing** (test only production-critical features)
3. **Update the TODO list** (mark code quality tasks as complete, focus on testing)
